# About Me

I'm Gautham — a data engineer by trade, an `O(n)` thinker aspiring to be `O(1)`, and someone whose first act in any new editor is fixing the tab settings — because if you're hitting the spacebar four times instead of Tab, Richard Hendricks (from `The Silicon Valley`) and I would like a word.

By day, I build ML infrastructure and data pipelines at Cisco that process more records than I've had cups of coffee — and if you know how much I love coffee (about as much as I love myself), that's a *lot* of records. My journey through the stack started with PLC controllers and SCADA systems in Abu Dhabi, took a detour through Oman's speed-camera databases, and eventually `git checkout`'d into the world of distributed systems, LLMs, and all things data. Fourteen-plus years in, I still get unreasonably excited when a Spark job finishes without a single retry.

When I'm not coaxing terabytes through pipelines or arguing with YAML configs, I write — Telugu poetry, essays on culture and humanity, and the occasional hot take on why *Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara* is basically a documentary. My love for mathematics, I think, is eternal — I sometimes wonder if I fantasize and romance with it more than is reasonable. I can happily lose myself in the multiverse of space, time, and all the black holes holding it together — and when the abstractions get too abstract, I pull my heaven on wheels out for a ride. I'm the kind of person who sees recursion in family traditions and `try-except` blocks in marriage. This site is where all of that collides: code and prose, equations and verse, throttle and thought.

If any of that sounds like your frequency, stick around. There's always something compiling.
